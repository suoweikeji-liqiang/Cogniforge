# Cogniforge

**Cogniforge is a cognitive learning engine designed to turn understanding into structured models.**

Most learning tools focus on consuming information.
Cogniforge focuses on forging cognition.

It helps users:

* Transform ideas into structured models
* Stress-test assumptions through contradiction
* Discover cross-domain structural similarities
* Track cognitive evolution over time
* Close the loop between theory and real-world practice

Instead of storing notes, Cogniforge builds:

* Model Cards
* Contradiction Logs
* Cross-domain Transfers
* Cognitive Evolution Records

The system operates on a simple principle:

> Learning is not information acquisition —
> it is model construction and iterative refinement.

Cogniforge combines:

* Interactive AI dialogue
* Structured model abstraction
* Boundary testing (model collision)
* Cross-domain mapping
* Evolution-aware version tracking

This project aims to build a reusable cognitive operating framework for engineers, researchers, and deep learners who want more than answers — they want mental architecture.
